# Thermal models of 60,000 North American residential buildings calibrated with measured data from Ecobee smart thermostats.

This is a public dataset of model parameters and information of 60,000 North American residential building thermal models calibrated with smart thermostat data. The building dynamics data come from Ecobee, a smart thermostats company based in Toronto, Canada. Ecobee offers the Donate Your Data (DYD) program to their costumers, allowing them to donate an anonymized dataset of the data logged by their thermostats.
